# File sharing website
A file sharing website created for a class assignment using PHP, HTML, and CSS. 

## How to use
Our file sharing service can be found here: http://ec2-18-118-2-214.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/~tatsuro/log_in.html
### Log in
You can log in to our file sharing service by simply entering existing usernames. Initially, there are four registered usernames, Alice, Bob, and Eve. 
You can enter one of these to log in. 
### Viewing file
Once you log in, you are directed to the file viewing page. At the top of the page, you can find a log out button in case you are done. Below that is a functionality to upload a new file to our secure location in the server. At the bottom of the page, you find a list of files that you uploaded. By selecting one file and clicking on either "View a file" or "Delete a file" and you can view or delete the chosen file. 

### Registration
We added a registration functionality. At the bottom of the log in portal, there is a registration form. You can type in a new username, and you can add the username to our list of users, if it was not already used. Our registration functionaliy also adds a secure private directory for a new user so that he/she can upload and view files. 
### Text editor
We added a text editor functionality. By clicking the create button in the file viewer page, you are directed to a text editor page. There, you can choose file name and edit a content for the text file. When you are done, you can click the save button to save the newly created text file in the user's directory.
